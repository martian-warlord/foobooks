<h1>Dear Lord Otwell</h1>
<p>I hereby challenge you to a duel for the honour of Laravel.</p>


<!-- <p>{{ $taylorTheVampireSlayer }}</p> double curly bracket echos variable value 
at sign syntax also works foreach endforeach   while  endwhile for endfor


and has UNLESS  endunless   syntax from i think python

also at sign include with file in brackets in single quotes  with no file extensions
-->




<p>{{ date('d/m/y') }}</p>
<p>{{ '<script>alert(“CHUNKY BACON!”);</script>' }}</p>

extra curly bracket adds escapes
<p>{{{ '<script>alert("CHUNKY BACON!");</script>' }}}</p>
